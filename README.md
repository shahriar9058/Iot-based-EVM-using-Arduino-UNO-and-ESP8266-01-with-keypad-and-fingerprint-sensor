# Iot-based-EVM-using-Arduino-UNO-and-ESP8266-01-with-keypad-and-fingerprint-sensor

In this project entitled “ IoT base Electronic 
Voting Machine” a small, lightweight, low cost EVM machine is designed that can be used in 
election. In this voting machine biometric fingerprint system is implemented because biometric 
identifiers cannot be easily misplaced or shared. The voters have to verify their fingerprint to cast 
their votes. If the fingerprint matched, the system will allow the voter to vote his/her favorite 
candidate. One voter can give only one vote to the candidate. The starting and the ending process 
is encrypted with a password that means only the authority can control the whole process. The 
voting records are stored to a cloud server using IoT so that in case any power failure or technical 
problem the latest result will remain stored in the server.

Components used-
Arduino Uno
ESp8266-01
16x2 LCD display
4x3 Matrix keypad 
JM-101 fingerprint sensor
